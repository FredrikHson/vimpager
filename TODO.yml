2.07:
- add usage screen
- either add multi file support or throw error and update docs
- better error message for unreadable files
- position cursor and display % on startup
- remove ;file from ;messages

FUTURE:
- tabs do not look correct in vimcat on Solaris
- colors seem different on solaris and other OSes
- allow clicking on man links in man and perldoc mode
- merge less.vim changes upstream
- save user's position in file on quit (using viminfo)
- stream large files and stdin instead of copying to /tmp
- key less dict values on bufnr, there are weird bugs with multiple buffers when toggling less mode

DONE:
- merge AnsiEsc changes upstream
- set cursor wrt scrolloff when toggling less mode
