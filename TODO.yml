2.07:
- for gvim only increase the number of columns if necessary for man pages
- stream large files and stdin instead of copying to /tmp
- allow clicking on man links in man and perldoc mode
- make vimpager usable from vim with pathogen and other plugin handlers

FUTURE:
- tabs do not look correct in vimcat on Solaris
- colors seem different on solaris and other OSes
- merge less.vim changes upstream
- save user's position in file on quit (using viminfo)

DONE:
- merge AnsiEsc changes upstream
- set cursor wrt scrolloff when toggling less mode
- remove ;file from ;messages
- add usage screen
- multiple file support
- better error message for unreadable files
- display actual file name on status line
- display statusline on startup
- key less dict values on bufnr, there are weird bugs with multiple buffers when toggling less mode
