# NAME

vimcat - vim based syntax highlighter

# SYNOPSIS

vimcat [options] file1 [file2 ...]

# DESCRIPTION
cat's a file to stdout, syntax-highlighting it using vim as a backend.

On GitHub: <http://github.com/rkitover/vimpager>

To use a different vimrc with vimcat, put your settings into a ~/.vimcatrc.

To disable loading plugins, put "set noloadplugins" into a ~/.vimcatrc file.

If output is not a terminal, it will simply run cat, so using vimcat in
pipe commands is safe. If you actually need the ANSI codes, use -o .

vimcat defaults to syntax on and set bg=dark. If you need bg=light do
something like this:

```bash
alias vimcat="vimcat -c 'set bg=light'"
```

# COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

## -c cmd

Run a vim command after opening the file. Multiple -c arguments are
supported.

## --cmd cmd

Run a vim command when entering vim before anything else. Multiple --cmd
arguments are supported.

## -u vimrc

Use an alternate .vimrc or .vimcatrc.

## -o output_file

Write output to output_file instead of the terminal. This works when
vimcat is not run on a terminal as well.

If output_file is "-" then output is written to STDOUT. An extra newline
will not be output if there isn't one at the end of the file with this
option, but will be in normal operation with a terminal.
